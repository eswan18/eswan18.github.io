title: State of the Tools 2020

---

I spend a lot of time on meta-productivity: thinking about how to get work done better and faster.
The majority of that thinking is around technology and specifically the tech tools I use.
Maybe thinking about my workflow has returns large enough to offset the time it consumes in my life, but frankly it doesn't matter too much to me since life optimization is as much a hobby as an objective.

2019 was a pretty good year. I picked up quite a few new tools, but not so quickly or so often that I felt I wasn't able to gain mastery of the ones I put time into.
Below is a fairly comprehensive list of the tech I use regularly.
I hope to make *State of the Tools* an annual tradition.

## Hardware
- **iPhone Xs Max** – My iPhone deserves to be the first item in this list. Screen time tells me I use it about 2 hours a day on average, a number which (I often say to my [Walden Ponding](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding) friends, winkingly) should really be higher.
- **MacBook Pro** – 16", late 2016
- **iPad Pro** – early 2018, pre-USB-C.
- **Desktop Ubuntu Workstation, with Windows Dualbooted**
- **AirPods Pro** – Ridiculously good.
- **Lots of Raspberry Pis**

## Software/Services

### Life Organization
- **Todoist** – Note that I also use Strides for some things but I haven't gotten too attached.
- **Fantastical**
- **Apple Notes**
- **Apple Mail** – Note I use Outlook for work accounts
- **Strides**
- **Lastpass**

### Fitness
- **MapMyFitness**
- **Gymaholic**

### Media
- **Overcast**
- **Spotify**
- **O'Reilly**
- **Feedly**
- **Instapaper**

### General Utilities
- **Alfred** – Used to use launchbar but it felt clunky and required purchase to do the things that I can do for free with Alfred.
- **Spectacle**

### Programming
- **iTerm**
- **Vim**
- **Python**

### Storage and Filesharing
- **Backblaze** – backups
- **Dropbox** – teaching
- **Google Drive** – podcast

### Other
- **Paprika**

## Honorable Mention
- **iStat Menus** - 
- **Mullvad VPN** - 
- **Drafts** – I'm still figuring out how Drafts fits into my workflow. I sketched the outline of this post there, but did all the actual writing right in my terminal. Not having Vim keybindings remains a near-dealbreaker.
- **Clipy**
- **Due** – for nightly reminders to get ready for bed
- **Eufy Life** – for smart scale
- **Slack** – for a few groups with specific purposes
- **Both Apple and Google Maps** – I waffle. Google Maps is bettter but Apple Maps has integration with the Apple Watch.
- **VSCode** – A tolerable Vim substitute when I need a visual feature, like markdown rendering.
- **Git** – Git is so obvious and standard that it's not really a "choice", so while I use it daily it stays in Honorable Mention.
- **Docker** - I don't use Docker as much as Git, but it occasionally solves a hard problem very quickly. Like Git, it's pretty much the standard tool for what it does.
