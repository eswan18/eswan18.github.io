Brick is a small coffee shop in Norwood, Ohio.
The interior is well-lit and clean, the wifi is usually more than adequate, and the coffee options are both reasonable and very good.
Power outlets are easy to come by.

In the past, Brick also offered excellent hours of operation, staying open until 8pm most evenings.
But no longer, and this once bar-setting establishment has fallen from a 9 to a 7.
The other drawback of Brick is its seating.
Coffee shop entrepreneurs everywhere, please stop this terrible trend of narrow, hard wooden chairs.
They make computer work unpleasant and sometimes almost impossible.
Improve the seating and maybe Brick can regain its spot atop my rankings.
