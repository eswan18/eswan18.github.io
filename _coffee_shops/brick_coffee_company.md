Brick is a small coffee shop in Norwood, Ohio.
The interior is well-lit and clean, the wifi is usually more than adequate, and the coffee is both reasonable and very good.
Itâ€™s also open normal hours every day, which few nice coffee shops can say.
Power outlets are easy to come by.
In almost all ways, Brick sets the bar.

What keeps Brick from a 10/10? Chair comfort.
Coffee shop entrepreneurs, please hear me: narrow, hard seating is a serious detriment.
That said, Brick is the best coffee shop Iâ€™ve visited in Cincinnati.
