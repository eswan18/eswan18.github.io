Landlocked is a newer coffee shop, nestled into Walnut Hills in what is otherwise a somewhat run-down area.
But Landlocked has created a very nice environment inside -- big windows, good lighting, a great modern and bright aesthetic.
It offers both coffee and beer (thus "Social House"), although I only visit during hours in which the latter probably wouldn't be appropriate.

Landlocked scores great on internet speed, interior design, hours (open late, although it might be more of a bar during that time).
But wow, the seating.
Landlocked fails spectacularly in its seating offerings, and it hurts the experience more than I thought bad seating could.
First, there are no chairs -- just stools and benches.
No back support at all, leading to my hunching over my computer for hours without relief.
Personally, I like to work slouched down in my chair to the point I'm basically parallel to the floor.
But not at Landlocked! 
Here we destroy spines.
Making this (already very bad) situation worse, the stools and benches are just perfectly flat pieces of wood.
No cushion, no divots.
Humans are made to sit, not stack flat.
<br><br>
This critical problem frustrates me all the more because Landlocked might be my favorite coffee shop in Cincinnati if it had remotely tolerable seating.
But I can't stay for more than about 45 minutes without developing acute back pain, so it just isn't a viable option.
