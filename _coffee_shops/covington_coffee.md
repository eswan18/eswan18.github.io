Unexpectedly reasonably-priced for a non-chain, Covington Coffee is a very small shop just off Route 71 in Northern Kentucky.
The ambience is great, although I have found the employees can occasionally be a bit too chatty for me to concentrate.
The internet speeds have always been good enough for me, and the coffee is good;
in fact, if you’re the kind of person that cares, you can watch your barista meticulously prepare your coffee in in ways that can’t possibly improve the flavor but may justify your opinion of yourself as someone who “knows coffee”.
Covington Coffee’s limited weekend hours are the major drawback.
I have twice shown up on Sunday afternoons to find the place closed, having shifted its hours since the last time I visited.

Update: Yelp now reports Covington Coffee as permanently closed.
Turns out that being open when you’re supposed to be open is important.
