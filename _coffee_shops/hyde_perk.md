Formerly known as Kidd Coffee, Hyde Perk is set between a mediterranean restaurant and an escape room.
Itâ€™s less than 3 minutes by foot from my apartment, so I feel obligated to walk there.
I donâ€™t really like walking, so thatâ€™s a bit of a drawback.

I find the ambience and chair comfort to be HPâ€™s strong suit.
On the other hand, itâ€™s too expensive and I am a little worried that the new name is an hommage to Friends (Central Perk), arguably the worst TV show I have consumed in entirety.
If Hyde Perk lowers its prices and is reincarnated as [CafÃ© Nervosa](http://thecheersfrasier.wikia.com/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Nervosa), it can expect a better rating next time.
