#starbs will efficiently serve you some moderately burned or bitter coffee for a nominal fee, and then provide you with mediocre internet.
On the plus side, locations are consistently clean and hours are good.

But overcrowding sometimes pushes you to less-than-ideal locations, and good luck in the inevitable passive-aggressive staring contest with the guy next to you who also needs to use that one power outlet.
