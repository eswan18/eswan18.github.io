People have recommended Carabello to me since I moved to Cincinnati.
Maybe itâ€™s not fair, but this local obsession with the place definitely affected my experience there.
It is indeed good in some ways â€“ lots of seating and a ton of drink options (even a coffee cocktail selection).
But the music is too loud and the place is very busy, to the point that I have been unable to sit down on several occasions.
As we all know, a coffee shop without a place to sit might as well be the Mr. Coffee in my kitchen.

Itâ€™s also very high up on the pretentiousness scale, which naturally rankles me a bit.
Still, Carabello is a fine choice and offers some amenities you just canâ€™t find elsewhere.
Maybe just bring a folding chair with you.
