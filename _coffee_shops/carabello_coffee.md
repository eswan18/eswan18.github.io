People have recommended Carabello to me since I moved to Cincinnati.
Maybe itâ€™s not fair, but this local obsession with the place negatively affected my experience there.
It is indeed good in some ways, offering a ton of drink options (even a coffee cocktail selection).
But the music is too loud, the chairs aren't great, and the place is very busy -- to the point that I have been unable to sit down on several occasions!
As we all know, a coffee shop without seating might as well be the Mr. Coffee in my kitchen.

Itâ€™s also very high up on the pretentiousness scale, which naturally rankles me a bit.
I guess Carabello is a fine choice if you're into coffee shops just for the coffee, but it has some flaws.
