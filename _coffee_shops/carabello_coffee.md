People have recommended Carabello to me since I moved to Cincinnati.
Maybe itâ€™s not fair, but this local obsession with the place negatively affected my experience there.
It is indeed good in some ways, offering a ton of drink options (even a coffee cocktail selection).
But the music is too loud, the chairs aren't great, and the place is very busy -- to the point that I have been unable to sit down on several occasions!
As we all know, a coffee shop without seating might as well be the Mr. Coffee in my kitchen.
<br><br>
Itâ€™s also very high up on the pretentiousness scale, which naturally rankles me a bit.
And worst of all, I recently visited and found a sign that said **they don't have wifi on Saturdays** to foster a sense of "community".
That's like choosing to turn off the water and electricity.
But worse.

I had no choice but to seriously drop Carabello from its already-weak ranking to a 3.
