People have recommended Carabello to me since I moved to Cincinnati.
Maybe itâ€™s not fair, but this local obsession with the place definitely affected my experience there.
It is indeed good â€“ lots of seating and a ton of drink options (even a coffee cocktail selection).
But the *background* music is too loud and the place is very busy, and honestly the coffee just isnâ€™t one of my favorites.
Itâ€™s also very high up on the pretentiousness scale, which is a personal turn off.
Still, Carabello is a safe choice and offers some amenities you just canâ€™t find elsewhere.
