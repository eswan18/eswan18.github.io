While in most aspects Coffee Emporium is an above average coffee shop, its stunningly terrible internet situation is simply too much to overcome.
At the Hyde Park location, you are allotted wifi in 45 minute increments, as if internet were a finite commodity.
But not only are you subjected to cyberspace rationing, the wifi speed is so bad that you would be better off tethering to your phone.

There is more I could say about Coffee Emporium, and most of it is positive.
But it doesnâ€™t matter because a place without internet is basically the wilderness.
