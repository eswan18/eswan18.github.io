You know what you’re getting with Panera.
There’s usually space, the hours are good, the coffee is cheap and pretty decent, and the environment is generally friendly – few things are more relaxing than being surrounded by old people.
Plus, free refills!

Unfortunately, you also know what you’re getting in internet speeds: it might be faster to walk to your ISP and back than to wait for a big webpage to load.
And the pastries are usually a disappointment.

If internet speed isn’t a priority, Panera is a fine option.
But who are we kidding? Internet speed is the priority.
