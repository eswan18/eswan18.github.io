Lookout Joe was my first love of Cincinnati coffee shops.
It sits on Mount Lookout Square, which means both a great atmosphere and free parking.
The coffee is good, the seating is limited, and the wifi quality is wildly variable.
It also has great hours, open until 8pm every weeknight.
Lookout Joe is the rare coffee shop that offers a good option for standing while working; it has several high tables, and high stools if sitting is more your style.
The additional outdoor seating, with umbrellas, means this place gets full marks in the seating category.

But coffee shops are about more than seating, and this one gets dinged on a few other measures (but not that many).
Lookout Joe can get a bit busy, and the regular short visits of passersby are a regular distraction.
The spotty wifi is a real problem, and the interior -- while homey -- does feel a bit dingy.
Still, Lookout Joe comes with my full recommendation overall.
