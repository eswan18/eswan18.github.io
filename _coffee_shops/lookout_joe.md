Lookout Joe was one of my first Cincinnati favorites.
It sits on Mount Lookout Square, which means both a nice atmosphere and free parking.
The coffee is good, the wifi is not, and the seating is limited.
Lookout Joe is the rare coffee shop that offers a good option for standing while working; it has several high tables, and high stools if sitting is more your style.
This, along with the outdoor tables, makes Lookout Joe the winner of the seating variety category.

But coffee shops are about more than seating, and this one gets dinged on a few other measures (but not that many).
Lookout Joe can get a bit busy, and the regular short visits of passersby are a regular distraction.
The spotty wifi is a real problem, and I find something about the atmosphere sometimes strikes me as a little dingy.
Still, Lookout Joe is a good option that I would recommend.
