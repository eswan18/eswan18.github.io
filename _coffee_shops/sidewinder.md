While it isn‚Äôt one of the coffee shops that Cincinnati natives typically recommend, Sidewinder is an outstanding cafe.
It‚Äôs located in Northside, right next to a cheese shop.
Talk about prime location!

Sidewinder has pretty good coffee, above-average chairs, and generally decent ambience; I do find it a little overpriced, though.
It would probably score as a solid 6 except for its best feature - outrageously good wifi.
As a millenial, all I care about is internet speed and avocado toast, and Sidewinder offers at least one of those things (it also serves food, so maybe both in the future!).
As a place to sit and be seriously productive, it‚Äôs very hard to beat Sidewinder.
