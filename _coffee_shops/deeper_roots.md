Once a subject of my scorn, Deeper Roots has improved the comfort of its seating situation dramatically and vaulted back into good coffee shop territory.
It has some of the best coffee in Cincinnati, but unfortunately also the air of a place that thinks it has good coffee.
I find the place kind of stuffy and the coffee descriptions to be so dramatic theyâ€™re hard to take seriously.
Another drawback is the constant in-and-out traffic the place attracts, which is very distracting.
Worse, the place is so small that I have several times visited and found no available seating â€“ a serious issue.

Still, good coffee, good seating, and good wifi is a strong enough combination to cancel out the drawbacks, so Deeper Roots comes out overall to be a very average coffee shop (average is okay!).
