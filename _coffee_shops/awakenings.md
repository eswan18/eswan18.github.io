Awakenings (or AWAKENINGS as their website screams) is a coffee and wine bar on Hyde Park Square.
The interior has a pleasant wooden aesthetic, and the coffee is pretty good.
However, the place is fairly expensive, doesn’t accept Apple Pay, and has a serious paucity of electrical outlets accessible from the tables.
Overall, a fairly unremarkable coffee shop.
