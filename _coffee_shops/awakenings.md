Awakenings is a coffee and wine bar on Hyde Park Square.
The interior has a pleasant wooden aesthetic, and the coffee is pretty good.
However, it doesn’t accept Apple Pay and has a serious paucity of electrical outlets accessible from the tables.
The atmosphere is also a little too quiet for comfortable conversation; even though I hang out with my laptop more than humans, this is occasionally a drawback.
Overall, it's a fairly unremarkable place.
