I learned about Ground Up via Foursquare, an app I've found to be a decent indicator of where I can find good coffee.
However, my disappointment was enormous upon purchasing and tasting my first ever (only?) beverage, an iced latte.
There's not much to say except that it was quite bad.

Still, the place is interesting, clean, and well-lit; the service was fine.
That's a 3.
