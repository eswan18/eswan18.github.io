        <p>Professionally, I work at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a> as a data scientist, engineering a better digital experience for Kroger customers. Beyond work, I spend my time learning more about computers, economics, statistics, and politics. Whatever spare thoughts I have left over are put toward national policy and technological innovation, two fields that I believe should be more closely intertwined - especially in the minds of this generation's next leaders.</p>

        <p>My college years were spent at Notre Dame, where I left with an undergrad degree in computer science and an MBA. Having grown up in Pittsburgh and recently relocated to Cincinnati, I'd like to think I've accidentally become a de facto Rust Belt expert.</p>

        <p>I am an enthusiastic participant in pickup sports, particularly basketball. Riddles, the violin, and video games are also close to my heart.</p>
