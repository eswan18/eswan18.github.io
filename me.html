        <p>I work at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a>, practicing data science in the pursuit of a better digital experience for Kroger customers. My college years were spent at Notre Dame, where I left with an undergrad degree in computer science and an MBA. Having grown up in Pittsburgh and recently relocated to Cincinnati, I'd like to think I've accidentally become a de facto Rust Belt expert.</p>

        <p>In the office, I work largely on end-to-end horizontal or vertical solutions, but also on some one-off analyses. Beyond work, I spend my time learning more about computers, economics, statistics, and politics - in that order. Whatever spare thoughts I have left over are put toward national policy and technological innovation, two fields that I believe should be more closely intertwined - especially in the minds of this generation's next leaders.</p>

        <p>I am an enthusiastic participant in pickup sports, particularly basketball. Riddles, the violin, and video games are also close to my heart.</p>
