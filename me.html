		<p>I'm a Data Analyst at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51˚</a> in Cincinnati. I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2016, with an undergraduate degree in computer science and an MBA.</p>
		<p>My primary fields are databases (relational and nonrelational), data anaysis, and automation tool development. Additionally, I'm interested in politics and political history, sports (particularly the NBA), and economics.</p>
		<p>In my free time, I appreciate video games, coffee shops, and occasionally playing violin. And I'll never turn down an invitation to pickup sports.</p>
