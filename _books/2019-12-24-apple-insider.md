This book was published well before Apple became what we know it as today: the iPod had just become popular and the iPhone didn't even exist.
That makes this book really refreshing because it doesn't have the hindsight bias of anything published in the iPhone era.
And because Apple is treated like a normal company, Steve Jobs is treated like a normal person -- in particular, held to the standards of a normal person.
And it does not go well for Steve in this account.

This book is also a good reminder that Apple actually *was* an innovator before the iPhone, but in areas most people have forgotten.
Overall, I'd strongly recommend it.
