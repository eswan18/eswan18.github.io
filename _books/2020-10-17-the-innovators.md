This book took me two years and two months to finish, but the vast majority was spent on the first half; I flew through the remainder in just the last few weeks. Basically, the book tracks the influential people and groups (the "innovators") in the history of computing, starting with Ada Lovelace and ending with founders of modern firms like Apple, Google, and Microsoft. I had a hard time getting through all the early names that were new to me and the somewhat obscure technologies they created.

However, starting with its coverage of the creation of Intel, the book is consistently interesting the rest of the way for anyone familiar with modern computing. Oddly it glosses over Bell Labs, but most other innovators in the computing world get some time. Despite the drudgery of the first couple hundred pages, this is a worthwhile read for any tech nerd.
