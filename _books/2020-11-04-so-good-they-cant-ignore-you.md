Newport is also the author of *Deep Work*, which has gained some acclaim in tech circles, so my hopes were fairly high for this book.
They were ... not reached.

Basically, *So Good They Can't Ignore You* tries to convey (generally reasonable if not paradigm-shifting) advice through the medium of anecdotes, and personally I find that style of writing somewhere between untrustworthy and patronizing.
You can find a story that proves anything you want, especially when it comes to career paths.
Ironically, Newport actually brings that up early on, mentioning that many successful people we idolize are actually unrepresentative of the typical path to happiness and achievement.
But then he goes on to repeatedly present a "finding" of his and back it up with a tale about a dedicated rock guitarist or a misguided artisanal yoga teacher.

Of all the advice presented, the only one that felt genuinely insightful was "little bets": the idea of dabbling in new things via small, incremental experiments.
Then you can reorient in the direction of the experiments that work and move past the ones that fail -- and additionally, you incur less risk at each step.
