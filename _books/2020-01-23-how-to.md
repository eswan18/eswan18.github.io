This was a fun, quick read.
Randall Munroe is the author of the widely beloved online comic XKCD, and his books have a very similar tone -- mostly funny, but occasionally educational.

For the kind of people who are interested in science and technology, this book is a nice change-of-pace from the dry reading they probably spend most of their time on.
