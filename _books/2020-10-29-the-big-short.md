A solid, readable book.
I felt I got some significant insight into the 2008 financial crisis, but I also got a distinct sense that some context was omitted to make for a compelling story.
Still, a quick fun read that I'd recommend to anyone interested in finance generally or the 2008 crisis specifically.
