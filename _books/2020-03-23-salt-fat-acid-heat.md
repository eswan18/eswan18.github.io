I had hoped this book would help build a foundational understanding of, well, the elements of good cooking.
It does lay some foundation, but unfortunately it spends most of its time on anecdotes and other "reinforcement" of the concepts, to its overall detriment.
There isn't much of a conceptual basis presented -- the concepts (salt, fat, acid, and head) are repeated often, but I wouldn't say they come with much evidence.
I left unconvinced that this was really the most important knowledge in the kitchen;
more chemistry and maybe research on taste would have gone a long way.

I found it tough to get through, but I *did* get some takeaways that will benefit me in my efforts to cook more.
Overall, better than simply reading recipes, but I made little progress in mastering the elements of good cooking.
