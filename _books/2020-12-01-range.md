This would have been a great read if it were a little shorter.
The first half or so is very data-driven, but the remainder is highly anecdotal and not very interesting (except for one chapter that contained a brief history of Nintendo).
Still, it was a thought-provoking read that really did enforce the lesson that generalists often make bigger impacts in fields, even if their paths are generally perceived as atypical.
