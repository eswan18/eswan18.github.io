An excellent primer on practical deep learning, using the Keras package in Python.
I've begun the book and failed to finish it a few times before, but this time I powered through.
It's far from riveting, but Chollet really does a great job explaining a difficult topic in an intuitive way, and the walkthroughs are mostly quite clear.
From what I've heard, this book is the gold standard for getting started with deep learning, and I can see why.
