For over a year, I've been looking for a book that could give me some background on how Unix and its adjacent technologies came to be.
This book achieved that goal perfectly, all in well under 200 pages.
It was a pleasant, quick read that brought new color to a lot of the technologies I use daily, including the text editor with which I composed this writeup (Vim).
The author was a member of Bell Labs during the development of Unix and C (and many more tools), and personally contributed to several technologies you may have used or at least heard of, such as Awk.

This was one of the best books I've read recently;
I'd highly recommend it to anyone who uses Linux or other Unix-inspired software -- like the MacOS command line -- regularly.
