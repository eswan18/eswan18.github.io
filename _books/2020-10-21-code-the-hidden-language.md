One of my favorite books ever.
Particularly in the first few chapters, the author conducts a master class in teaching computer and electrical engineering in an approachable way.
As a tech enthusiast with extremely limited understanding of hardware, my horizons were broadened greatly -- and at various points I had a hard time putting the book down.
I left with a reasonable grasp of countless ideas that I knew were foundational to computer science but which I could never have begun to explain myself.

Notably, I encountered this book at the perfect time in my life, having really developed my knowledge of high-level software in the past few years and just beginning to dive into the lower levels.
But I think almost anyone with a strong quantitative background and an interest in how computers work would appreciate this book.
