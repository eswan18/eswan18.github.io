Ultimately, I am probably not the right audience for this book.
It's a dicussion of how to be a better programmer, covering both coding practices and meta-work, like collaboration and planning skills.
However, very few ideas weren't obvious to anyone who has ever taken a step back and considered how to improve.
Admittedly, there are people who aren't inclined to take part in that kind of reflection, but those same people seem unlikely to read a book about it.

The writing quality is fine but not great, and there are some cheesy metaphors throughout.
Still, it's a quick read and didn't dispense any advice I outright disagreed with, but I can't say it particularly shed new light on anything.
