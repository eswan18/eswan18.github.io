		Ranking local coffee shops has allowed me to pursue 2 of my favorite hobbies: visiting local caf&eacute;s, and complaining about things.

				<th>Description<br></th>

				<td>Panera</td>
				<td>You know what you're getting with Panera. There's usually space, the hours are good, the coffee is cheap and pretty decent, and the environment is generally friendly - few things are more relaxing than being surrounded by old people. Plus, free refills!<br><br>
                    Unfortunately, you also know what you're getting in internet speeds - it might be faster to walk to your ISP and back than to wait for a big webpage to load. And the pastries are usually a disappointment. Still, it's hard to beat the overall value proposition of Panera as long as fast wifi isn't a priority.<br><br>

				<td>Starbucks</td>
				<td>#starbs will efficiently serve you some moderately burned or bitter coffee for a nominal fee, and then provide you with mediocre internet. On the plus side, locations are consistently clean and hours are good.<br><br>
                    But overcrowding sometimes pushes you to less-than-ideal locations, and good luck in the inevitable passive-aggressive staring contest with the guy next to you who also needs to use that one power outlet.<br><br>

				<td>Covington Coffee</td>
                <td>Unexpectedly reasonably-priced for a non-chain, Covington Coffee is a very small shop just off Route 71 in Northern Kentucky. The ambience is great, although I have found the employees can occasionally be a bit too chatty for me to concentrate. The internet speeds have always been good enough for me, and the coffee is good; in fact, if you're the kind of person that cares, you can watch your barista meticulously prepare your coffee in in ways that can't possibly improve the flavor but may justify your opinion of yourself as someone who "knows coffee". Covington Coffee's limited weekend hours are the major drawback; I have twice shown up on Sunday afternoons to find the place closed, having shifted its hours since the last time I visited.<br><br>
                    Update: Yelp now reports Covington Coffee as permanently closed. Turns out that being open when you're supposed to be open is important.<br><br>

            <tr>
                <td>Brick Coffee Company</td>
                <td>Brick is a small coffee shop in Norwood, Ohio. The interior is well-lit and clean, the wifi is usually more than adequate, and the coffee is both reasonable and very good. It's also open normal hours every day, which few nice coffee shops can say. Power outlets are easy to come by. In almost all ways, Brick sets the bar.<br><br>
                    What keeps Brick from a 10/10? Chair comfort. Coffee shop entrepreneurs, please hear me: narrow, hard seating is a serious detriment. That said, Brick is the best coffee shop I've visited in Cincinnati.<br><br>
