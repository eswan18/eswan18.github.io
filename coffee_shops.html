		Ranking local coffee shops has allowed me to pursue 2 of my favorite hobbies: visiting local cafes, and complaining about things.

				<th>Coffee Shop</th>
				<th>Description<br><br></th>
				<th>Rating (0-9)</th>

			<tr>
				<td>Panera</td>
				<td>You know what you're getting with Panera. There's usually space, the hours are good, the coffee is cheap and pretty decent, and the environment is generally friendly - few things are more relaxing than being surrounded by old people.
				Unfortunately, you also know what you're getting in internet speeds; that it might be faster to walk to your ISP and back than to wait for a big webpage to load. Oh, and the pastries are usually a disappointment. Still, it's hard to beat the overall value of Panera as long as fast wifi isn't a priority.<br><br></td>
				<td>5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Starbucks</td>
				<td>Starbucks will efficiently serve you some moderately burned or bitter coffee for a nominal fee, and then provide you with mediocre internet. On the plus side, locations are consistently clean and hours are good.
				But overcrowding sometimes pushes you to less-than-ideal locations, and good luck in the inevitable passive-aggressive staring contest with the guy next to you who also needs to use that one power outlet.</td>
				<td>4</td>
