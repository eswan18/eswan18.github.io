		Ranking local coffee shops has allowed me to pursue 2 of my favorite hobbies: visiting local caf&eacute;s, and complaining about things.

			<tr>
				<th width="15%;">Coffee Shop</th>
				<th>Description<br></th>
				<th width="15%;">Rating (0-9)</th>

			<tr>
				<td>Panera</td>
				<td>You know what you're getting with Panera. There's usually space, the hours are good, the coffee is cheap and pretty decent, and the environment is generally friendly - few things are more relaxing than being surrounded by old people. Plus, free refills!<br><br>
				Unfortunately, you also know what you're getting in internet speeds; that it might be faster to walk to your ISP and back than to wait for a big webpage to load. Oh, and the pastries are usually a disappointment. Still, it's hard to beat the overall value of Panera as long as fast wifi isn't a priority.<br><br></td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Starbucks</td>
				<td>Starbucks will efficiently serve you some moderately burned or bitter coffee for a nominal fee, and then provide you with mediocre internet. On the plus side, locations are consistently clean and hours are good.<br><br>
				But overcrowding sometimes pushes you to less-than-ideal locations, and good luck in the inevitable passive-aggressive staring contest with the guy next to you who also needs to use that one power outlet.<br><br></td>
				<td>4</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Covington Coffee</td>
				<td>Unexpectedly reasonably-priced for a non-chain, Covington Coffee is a very small shop just off Route 71 in Northern Kentucky. The ambience is great, although I have found the employees can occasionally be a bit too chatty for me to concentrate.<br><br>
				The internet speeds have always been good enough for me, and the coffee is good; in fact, if you're the kind of person that cares, you can watch your barista meticulously prepare your coffee in in ways that can't possibly improve the flavor but may improve your personal feeling of being cultured and knowledgeable about "quality" coffee.
