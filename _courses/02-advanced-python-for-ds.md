##### Description
This is a two-day course that introduces how one can use Python for advanced data science tasks, such as deep learning and natural language processing. 
Most of the time will be spent working through example problems end-to-end in the classroom. 
Students will learn the fundamentals of the Keras package (for deep learning) and will explore several NLP packages and methodologies to see the strengths of each. 
Some additional time will be reserved for discussion of real programming challenges students have encountered, and for an overview of related relevant technologies students may need in an industry setting (e.g. Git and GitHub).

##### Objectives
1. Develop an intuition for what problems are suited to deep learning- and/or NLP-based solutions.
2. Build familiarity with the basic interfaces of key Python libraries for deep learning and NLP: [Keras](http://keras.io), [FuzzyWuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy), and [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/).
3. Gain a high-level understanding of the function of data science-adjacent technologies that students will encounter in the workplace, focusing on [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com).
