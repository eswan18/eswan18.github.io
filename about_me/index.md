I'm a Chicago-based data scientist and technology specialist.
I build internal packages and other tech tools as part of the ecosystem team at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a>, the marketing analytics agency of Kroger.
I also teach [Python workshops and courses](/courses) at the University of Cincinnati and do some freelance data science consulting.

In my free time, I like to run, read, and listen to podcasts.
I occasionally dabble in personal projects as well, which usually involve Raspberry Pis, Python, or both.
I blog about some of those projects [here](/).
