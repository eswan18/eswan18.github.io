I'm a Cincinnati-based data scientist and technology specialist. I work on the talent development team at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a>, the marketing analytics agency of Kroger.
I also teach Python courses at the University of Cincinnati as an adjunct instructor and do some freelance data science consulting.

I contribute to [The Syntact Project](http://syntactproject.com) as an editor, writer, and podcaster --
find my contributions [here](http://syntactproject.com/contributors/ethan_swan.html).
I occasionally dabble in personal projects as well, which usually involve Raspberry Pis, Python, or both.
I blog about some of those projects [here](/).

In my free time, I like to run, play pickup sports, and listen to many, [many](/web_content) podcasts.
