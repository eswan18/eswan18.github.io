I'm a Cincinnat-based data scientist specializing in technology on the talent development team at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a>, the marketing analytics agency of Kroger.
On the side, I teach Python courses at the University of Cincinnati and do some freelance data science consulting.

I got my MBA and BS in computer science at Notre Dame, but my interests also include economics, political science, and the NBA.
In my free time, I like running, pickup sports, and many [many](/rec_content.html) podcasts.
I contribute to [The Syntact Project](http://syntactproject.com) as an editor, writer, and podcaster --
find my contributions [here](http://syntactproject.com/contributors/ethan_swan.html) --
and enjoy dabbling in occasional tech projects, some of which I blog about [here](/).
