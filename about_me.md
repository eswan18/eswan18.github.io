I'm a data scientist on the talent development team at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a>.
My background is in computer science, but my interests also include political science, economics, and the NBA.
In my free time, I like running, pickup sports, technology projects, and many [many](/rec_content.html) podcasts.

On the side, I contribute to [The Syntact Project](http://syntactproject.com) as an editor, writer, and podcaster --
find my contributions [here](http://syntactproject.com/contributors/ethan_swan.html).
I also help out on the [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) Python package.
