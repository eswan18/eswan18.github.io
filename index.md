# About Me
<img src="images/ethan_headshot_smiling.gif" width="220" height="330" style="float:left; padding:0px 20px 5px 10px; display:block;"/>

I am a data scientist at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a>.
Beyond work, I spend my time learning more about computers, economics, statistics, and politics.
Whatever spare thoughts I have left over are put toward national policy and technological innovation, two fields that I believe should be more closely intertwined - especially in the minds of this generation's next leaders.

My college years were spent at Notre Dame, where I left with an undergrad degree in computer science and an MBA
.
Having grown up in Pittsburgh and recently relocated to Cincinnati, I'd like to think I've accidentally become a de facto Rust Belt expert.

I am an enthusiastic participant in pickup sports, particularly basketball.
Riddles, the violin, and video games are also close to my heart.
