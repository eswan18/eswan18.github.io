# About Me
<img src="images/ethan_headshot_smiling.gif" width="220" height="330" style="float:left; padding:0px 20px 5px 10px; display:block;"/>

I'm a data scientist on the pricing team at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a>.
I also contribute to [The Syntact Project](http://syntactproject.com) as an editor, writer, and podcaster.
My background is in computer science, but my interests also include economics, politics, psychology, and the NBA.

I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and an MBA from Notre Dame.
In my free time, I like running, pickup sports, more video games than I care to admit, and many [many](/rec_content.html) podcasts.
