I'm a Chicago-based data scientist and technology specialist.
I build internal packages and other tech tools as part of the ecosystem team at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a>, the marketing analytics agency of Kroger.
I'm passionate about technical tooling and technology education.

Outside of work, I teach [Python workshops and courses](/courses/), offer private [office hours](/office_hours/) to help with data science tools, and do some freelance data science consulting.
If you're interested in any of these services, please reach out to me by email at [ethanpswan@gmail.com](mailto:ethanpswan@gmail.com).

In my free time, I like to run, read, and listen to podcasts.
I even make [a podcast of my own](https://premature-optimization.pinecast.co).
Occasionally I dabble in personal projects as well, which usually involve Raspberry Pis, Python, or both.
I blog about some of those projects [here](/).
